<h2>Description</h2>
Intended for educational purposes only. Only use a computer you don't care if it gets destroyed. After all...it is malware.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>A text editor</b>
- <b>Python 3.10 (64-bit)</b> 


<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Linux Kali 5.16.0-kali7-amd64</b> (21H2)

<h2>Walk-through:</h2>

<p align="center">
1. Launch a terminal and create some directories with files inside: <br/>

<br />
<br />
2. Create a new python file. I'll use nano to make mine. I'll name mine 'loki.py'  <br/>

<br />
<br />
3. We need to find all the files in a system and import os. <br/>

<br />
<br />
4. But we need to make sure we don't encrypt our file 'loki.py', so we tell it to ignore it.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
5. ctrl+x to save the file, Y, and enter. Now test the script to see if it works.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
6. We want to encrypt individual files, not folers. I created a foler 'hi' to make sure it works. Let's fix that. We also import fernet so we can encrypt. <br/>

<br />
<br />
7. To encrypt the files will use Fernet, this will ensure the encrypted files can't be read without the key. Let's also create the key and test it.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
8. Observe the key under the files.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
9. Back to the code. Delete the print key function (we don't want to give them the key). We will save the key to a file. Write the new code, save, and test. <br/>

<br />
<br />
10. After testing  'loki.py' you can ls and see the 'thekey.key' file. 'cat thekey.key' to see the key. <br/>

<br />
<br />
11. We need to tell loki to ignore the key file. We don't want to encrypt our key. Also we add code to encrypt the data :D. Save & test. <br/>

<br />
<br />
12. Run 'loki.py' then 'ls' and 'cat' the files to see they are now encrypted.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
13. Cat 'thekey.key' for the key to unlock it.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
14. How to unlock. We will write a decryption script. Similar to the loki script so we copy, rename, and edit. So we should have two .py files now, loki and decrypt.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
15. We don't need to create a key so we take that code out. Instead of encrypting we are decryping so we change that code as well. We also have to add 'decrypt.py' to ignore. Save and run.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
16. After running 'decrypt.py' you can ls and cat the files to see the are now decrypted.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
17. We can add some fun to the file. "Send bitcoin to unlock files @ !!" Nano into 'loki.py' and edit the code.<br/>

<br />
<br />
18. Now let's make it so they have to enter a secret password for the script to decrypt their files. nano 'decrypt.py'. Add code and save.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
19. There it is. Run 'loki.py' to encrypt and 'decrypt.py' to decrypt with secret phrase!  <br/>
